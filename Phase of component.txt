Note:- all these method are use only in a CLASS BASED component not in function based component

Phase of component
1. Mounting:- the process of creating an element and inserting it into a DOM tree.(jb hm sare componets ko machine se wesite me send krte hai)
2. Updating:- the process of changing state or props of component and Update changes to nodes already in the DOM
3. Error Handling :- it use when there is Error during rendring in lifecycle method or in the constructor of any child component
4. Unmounting :- the process of removing components from the DOM

-->>> Mounting :- several phase in Mounting run in sequence
1. constructor() :- sbse pahle yhi call hota hai. When implementing the constructor use super(props) before any other statement
                 :- it is mostly use for initialise state 
                 :- constructor(props){
                     super(props);
                     this.state={
                         name: 'this.props.name',
                         roll: 5                
                     }
                 }
2. static getDerivedStateFromProps()
3. render() :- 
4. componentDidMount() :- this method is invoked immedeiatly after a component is mounted(inserted into the tree),after the render() method has taken place
                       :- this method is executed onse in a lifecycle of a component and after the first render
                       :- it will initialise the DOM nodes should go here
                       NOTE:- the API calls should be made in this method ALWAYS
